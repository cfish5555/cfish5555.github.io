        <h2>What is Adapted Physical Education?</h2>
        <p>Before you can teach an adapted physical education class, you must first define what exactly it is. Adapted physical education is the planning, development, and implementation of physical education instruction for learners with unique needs and abilities. Often these unique needs are a result of mental or physical disabilities. Adapted physical education focuses on the same principles as a general physical education class such as gross motor skills, fitness, group games, and sports. However, with adapted physical education the instruction is individualized to the need of the learner. This individualized instruction may take place in an environment that is integrated (i.e., general education environments) or segregated (i.e., only with students receiving adapted physical education). No matter the environment, it is the role of the educator to provide the best possible instruction for the needs of the learner.</p>

    <h2>Assessing the Abilities of Your Learner</h2>
    <p>Assessment is important in all areas of education, but even more so when teaching adapted physical education. Every learner, whether it be in general education or special education, comes with their own set of physical and cognitive abilities. Because of this, assessment is crucial in determining the needs of your students. In some cases, it will be obvious that a learner needs adaptations to be successful. However, this is not always the case. You may have two learners with the same disability diagnosis but have drastically different ability levels. By administering different types of assessments, you can determine which adaptations are appropriate for the learner.</p>

    <h2>Adapting Activities to the Needs of Your Learner</h2>
    <p>After determining the needs of your learners, you must modify and adapt your activities to fit these needs. Adaptations can come in a variety of ways, and it is up to the educator to find what is appropriate. Educators can modify parts of the lesson such as equipment, rules, time, actions, or the playing field. Often, with learners with disabilities, the activity will be simplified to allow for more success. However, there are many situations where challenging the learner more is the appropriate response. The ability to adapt to students is not a simple task. What works in one class/learner may not work in another. The more training and experience the educator gains, the easier this will become. Experienced educators will not only know what adaptations to make, but they will know when they are appropriate. </p>

    <h2>Incorporating Inclusion into the Classroom</h2>
    <p>Inclusion is a common term you will hear in education. Inclusion is defined as being included in a group. For the purposes of adapted physical education this means that all learners will be included in a class regardless of their ability levels. In most scenarios, the learner with a disability will be placed in a class/group with students without a disability. Activities will then be modified so that all learners can be successful and at the same time being challenged. However, in some cases inclusion may not be possible. A disability may be too severe for a general education class. In this scenario a learner will need an adapted only class or individual instruction.</p>

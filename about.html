            <p>	Welcome! My name is Casey Fisher, and I am a health and physical education teacher from Erie, Pennsylvania. Over the past six years I have worked with a variety of students at the middle school and elementary level. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Health and Physical Education with a minor in Adapted Physical Activity from Slippery Rock University. I am also pursuing a master’s degree in Learning Technologies and Design from the University of Missouri. Throughout my teaching career I have gained experience teaching students with mental and physical disabilities. I have a passion for creating an inclusive environment that allows all students to feel welcomed and at the same time be challenged academically. Through education, we can view a person for their abilities rather than their disabilities. In addition to teaching, I also have experience coaching adapted sports teams for basketball and cross country.  I 
            additionally have coaching experiences at the high school varsity level for track and field and golf.</p>

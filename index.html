            <p>Schools often separate students by their abilities, but not usually in physical education. In this class you will see students of all shapes, sizes, and abilities. This is a true challenge! Welcome to adapted physical education! </p><p>Physical education teachers have the unique situation to teach students of all ability levels. It can be a challenge to provide a high-quality education to all of these students at the same time. Some students will need many adaptations, while others will need to be challenged even more. Here you will find the basics of adapting physical education to meet the needs of all students. Learning to teach adapted physical education takes practice and experience, but after reading through this website you can expect to have a better understanding on how to teach all students.</p>

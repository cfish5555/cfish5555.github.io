     Hello everyone! My name is Casey Fisher and this is my first semester in the ISLT program. I live in Erie, Pennsylvania and over the past 6 years I have worked as a physical education teacher at an elementary school. My goal is to use this degree to move into a technology position within my school district. I have some web development training during my time as an undergraduate. As a student worker I was tasked with updating my programs information on the universityâ€™s website. This was only basic training, so I am excited to dive deeper into web design. In my free time I like to stay active. I enjoy running, biking, and playing in many sports leagues. Some of these include softball, golf, cornhole, and ultimate frisbee. In addition to this, I enjoy working on home improvement projects. I purchased a fixer-upper two years ago and the transformation of my home has been a gratifying experience.
